First I downloaded coreutils to my local machine then used scp to transfer
coreutils to the linux server

I then used tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz to unzip the file

Then I used ./configure --prefix=$pwd/coreutilsInstall which took a while to
configure all the files within the coreutils8.29 I then used make which again
took a while compiling the files and then make install to install coreutils

I tested the difference between ./src/ls -aA and ./bin/ls -aA and they both
printed the files in the directory with . and .. directories

I then copied the patch file into a file named patch_file, entered the src
directory and used the command patch -p1 < patch_file to apply the patch to
the program. -p1 was necessary to remove the leading '/' to apply the patch
correctly

I then was able to check to see if the patch works by using the patched src
file with command ./src/ls -aA and seeing no . or .. directories
I checked the original unmodified file in a different directory with
command ./bin/ls -aA which still printed the . and .. directories

Therefore the patch was successful
