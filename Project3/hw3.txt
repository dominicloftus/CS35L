1.) This patch improves the ls function because it now conforms to the
standard that -a and -A override each other, however it makes performance
slightly worse because it now needs to check for the overriding of the other

2.) This probably wouldn't be any problems for a company adopting this patch
because it is fairly intuitive. However if someone was unfamiliar or was
expecting a different output it could throw them off. Or if they had some kind
of programmed command that was dependent of the old output of the ls command
it could mess up an expected output they could have been using for a while

3.) When an empty file is input, the program throws an error that that there
are 0 lines in the file, and then nothing else will happen in the program

4.) When the script is invoked with python3 it causes an error because the
syntax in which the IO error message is displayed is incorrect
