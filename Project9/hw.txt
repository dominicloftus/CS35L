I created a new branch of v3.0 called quote using command
git checkout v3.0 -b quote
which output
M	src/cmp.c
M	src/diff.c
M	src/diff3.c
M	src/dir.c
M	src/sdiff.c
M	src/side.c
M	src/util.c
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3/
I then added my patch using the command
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
which patched the above files

5/
I then composed the change log with
emacs ChangeLog
C-x 4 a
and then listing each .c file changed with the description
: Replaced grave accent with apostrophe

6/
I then commited the changes with commands
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog
with the change log just created

7/
I then generated the patch using
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Partner: Luke Jung
UID: 904982644
Next was to verify that the patch would work on my partner's server
First I gave him a copy of my formatted patch. He then created a new v3.0
branch called partner. He also needed to apply the gets patch used in the
lab. Then he used the command
git am < formatted-patch.txt
to apply the patch and then built the program with commands
./bootstrap
./configure
make

when he tried to use make check it didn't work, however on piazza there was
a post saying that as long as ./src/diff . - output the correct error
message that it was fine. He ran the command
./src/diff . -
and it output
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory


9/
I then used the command
make distdir
in the partner branch and then cd'd into the resulting directory and opened
the change log file. The file contained the change log writted by my partner
above the rest of the previous change log.
