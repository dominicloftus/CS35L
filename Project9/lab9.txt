1/
First I got a clone of the diffutils repository with the command
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils
which created a directory in my current directory

2/
Next I used
git log > ../git-log.txt
to get the log

3/
Then I used
git tag > ../git-tags.txt
to get the tags

4/
Next I entered emacs for git-log.txt and used
C-s maint: quote
to find correct commit

I was then able to generate a patch for it using command
git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > \
../quote-patch.txt
which placed the patch into the parent directory

5/
Next I checked out version 3.0 of diffutils using
git checkout v3.0 -b mybranch
which switched diffutils to a new v3.0 branch

6/
Then I applied the patch using command
patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
which began patching. It ran into problems however from 

The following files not existing
HACKING
doc/diffutils.texi
man/help2man

and from Hunk fails at
README - 9, 60
README-hacking - 19
cfg.mk - 29
src/diff.c - 879, 906, 942
src/diff3.c - 433

7/
I then used
git status
which gave the following output

On branch mybranch

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

9/
Next I had to revert all changes to files other than .c
So I used the commands
emacs (filename)
C-x v u
and answered yes to the prompt given for (filename)s
NEWS, README, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat, ms/config.site,
po/en.po, src/diff.h, src/system.h, and tests/help-version

to revert all these files

Next was to fix the comments in the .c files. I did this by first opening
each file in emacs then using the command
C-x v =
which opened up a window of applied hunks. I scrolled through the hunks and
for each one that was a comment I used command
C-u C-c C-a
to undo the hunk. If I was unsure if it was a comment I would use
C-c C-c
to go to the point in source code and check if it was a comment, then fix it


10/
Next was to fix the .c files that also produced /src/*.c.rej files by going
through them and changing them by hand. There were 5 hunks needing to be fixed
in diff.c and 1 in diff3.c

11/
Next I used
git status
to find all untracked files

I then used
git clean -n
to do a dry run to make sure the correct files were being removed

Then I used
git clean -f
to actually remove the files needed

12/
Now
git status
outputs the following

On branch mybranch
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/side.c
	modified:   src/util.c

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

I then used command
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
to create the patch file, it was about 360 lines so it is in the correct range

13/
Next I ran the command
./bootstrap
which took a while to run and added more files to the directory

Then because I was on lnxsrv09 I needed to apply the patch using commands
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
needed to change "old" to "lib" in patch because the was no old directory
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff

Then I ran
./configure
make

After this I was able to test this by using command
./src/diff . -
which output
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
with the correct ' instead of `

I also did
./src/diff --help
which also printed the correct quotations

14/
Next was to perform a sanity check by comparing this to the original version.
I got the original by using the command
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-3.0

I then set it to v3.0 using
git checkout v3.0 -b mybranch

I also needed to rename the directory I had been working under previously with
mv diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch

Then I needed to get the source code from both by copying the .c files
so I made two directories
mkdir diffutils-3.0-src
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch-src

and copied the .c files into each using
cp ./diffutils-3.0/src/*.c ./diffutils-3.0-src
cp ./diffutils-3.0-patch/src/*.c ./diffutils-3.0-patch-src

Next was to diff the two directories using command
./diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0-src diffutils-3.0-patch-src \
> quote-3.0-test.txt

15/
Next I compated quote-3.0-test.txt with quote-3.0-patch.txt with command
diff quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-test.txt
which output a lot of text, however when looking through the code, the only
real differences were in the ` being changed to a '. So the differences
between them would be innocuous.
