The network that we established would still be secure because the data
that I was transfering was encrypted using my partner's public key. So
even if they were able to monitor these bytes, they would only see the
encrypted data and because only my partner had the private key that
is needed to interpret the data and the private key is never sent
across any servers.

If the other team were able to monitor our keystrokes, then our
network would still be secure because the keystrokes alone are not enough
to recreate the private key to decode our data.

If they had access to the physical usb device however then they would
be able to observe all of the data that we are passing over the network
because they would have access to the files that are stored on the device
containing the private key.

This command doesn't truly verify that I was the one who created the file
because it only checks to ensure that the integrity of the signiture is
intact. If someone else was able to intercept and encode it with a
different public key and regenerate the signiture for that key then
gpg --verify would still work.

One way to fix this is to publish the public key so that when the data
is recieved, you are able to check the key recieved against the one that
it's supposed to be and verify it this way.
